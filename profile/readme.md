## The `uinix` philosophy
All `uinix-js` packages are built with the `uinix` philosophy in mind.

The `uinix` philosophy borrows spiritually from the [Unix philosophy], with contextual adjustments for UI development.

The following principles summarize the `uinix` philosophy:

### Functional minimalism
APIs are simple and clear, and reduced to a minimum.  Programs should do one thing and do it well.

### Interoperable
Programs should be easily compsable and work well together.

### Framework-agnostic and JS-first
`uinix-js` packages are framework/build/tool-free.  It runs as plain simple Javascript.  We confidently observe that all frameworks are ephemeral, and only JS will remain indefinitely as the universal interface for the web.

### Your configuration, your rules ðŸ¤˜
APIs aim to be unopinionated, but provide relevant configuration to domains to customize to their needs.

### Dependency-less
Dependencies are sparingly used or, at the very least, carefully considered.  You are installing and using just `uinix-js` packages, and dependencies should never surface and affect usage.

### Update-free
The goal is to arrive to a stable and update-free API.
